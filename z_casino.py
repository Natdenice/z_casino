| Quick rules:                                                                 |

| The player bet on a number between 0 and 49 (50 numbers in all).             |
| By choosing his number, he deposits the amount he wants to bet.              |
|                                                                              |
| The roulette consists of 50 boxes naturally ranging from 0 to 49.            |
| Even numbers are black, odd numbers are red.                                 |
|                                                                              |
| The dealer throws the roulette, drops the ball and when the roulette stops,  |
| note the number of the box in which the ball has stopped.                    |
| The number on which the ball stopped is, of course, the winning number.      |
|                                                                              |
| If the winning number is the one on which the player has bet,                |
| the dealer gives him 3 times the sum bet.                                    |
|                                                                              |
| Otherwise, the dealer looks at whether the number bet by the player          |
| is the same color as the winning number (if they are both odd or both even). |
|                                                                              |
| If so, the dealer gives him 50% of the sum bet.                              |
| If this is not the case, the player loses his bet.                           |
|                                                                              |
